# MyReads Project

This is the project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. I was provided with a static template and my task was to refractor the code into React, adding interactivity and persistent results of this interaction.

## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`


## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, I was provided with a backend server to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods to perform necessary operations on the backend.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
